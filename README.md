# Password Generator

## Project status
This project is complete.

## Description
A challenge for myself to build a basic password generator, relying on knowledge acquired so far and researching new concepts on JavaScript. The aim was to see if my understanding of JavaScript tools and functions were sufficient to build a basic prompts-to-calculations-to-print web app. The activity was a useful test of my skills and there were elements of it I had never faced before. The page showcases random-selector tools, prompts and confirms, variable storing from functions and a brief introduction to printing to the html. It is a simple but functional app for generating passwords from a random selection of letters, numbers and special characters.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
The title shows the name of the student whose portfolio it is. The navigation bar features links which can be used to navigate the sections within the page, including a skills section, an 'About Me' section, a previous work section, a useful resources drop-down and a section with modes of contacting the student. Navigating to each section, the sections are expanded upon with content, visual aids and links.

## Contributing
As this is a personal project, designed to challenge and test my skills, I am not currently looking for contributors. However, there may be a opening for this in the future.
